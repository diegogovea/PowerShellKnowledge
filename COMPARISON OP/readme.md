In PowerShell, comparison operators are used to compare values and objects. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some common comparison operators and their usage:

1. Equal (-eq): This operator checks if two values are equal. For example:
```powershell
$a = 12
$b = 37
$result = $a -eq $b  # Returns False
```

2. Not Equal (-ne): This operator checks if two values are not equal. For example:
```powershell
$result = $a -ne $b  # Returns True
```
3. Greater Than (-gt): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand. For example:

```powershell
$result = $a -gt $b  # Returns False
```
4. Less Than (-lt): This operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. For example:

```powershell
$result = $a -lt $b  # Returns True
```
